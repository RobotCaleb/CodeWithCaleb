# Session 1 - Perlin Noise
Playing with Perlin noise with JavaScript on an HTML5 canvas.

I saw a neat effect in a [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5BAYGR1ddY) for a game called [Aerobat](http://aerobat.thew.nu/). The ship spits out a cool ribbon-like trail as it flies. In this session I attempted to create something pretty similar using Perlin noise.

Uses the noise.js library from [https://github.com/josephg/noisejs](https://github.com/josephg/noisejs)
